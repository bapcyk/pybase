This is the library of classes for HMI creation (Python 2). I used it for my small SCADA system.
It consists of subsystems:

- vector graphic based on Gimp's GFig (support affine transformations, labeling, attributes changing, etc.)
- central net broker, like net directory (discavering of a peers)
- multi-threading console
- auto-respawning thread (after failure)
- virtual root
- validators
- config. file parser (with UI)
- asynchronous Tk
- Tk dialogs (properties, configfile, login, etc.)
